Character state
- [ ] saved character file and loadable worldstate
- [ ] hunger counter
    this ticks up as your character acts, ticking up faster for physically/mentally exerting actions. Your character's statuses determine the kind of food they find palatable (e.g: cursed characters want meat/rotten food, wizards want fancy or esoteric foods). The palatability of the food you consume will determine its effects on your character's emotions. Your character won't need to eat too often (kept realistic to time passing), but the food you eat will provide bonuses and maluses
- [ ] character creation step
    The player chooses a number of personality traits for their character that create synergies between emotions and stances. (e.g: the "malcontent" personality trait gives bonuses to happiness while in the aggro stance, the "utilitarian" trait gives bonuses to happiness when consuming simple foods or performing efficacious actions, and the "melacholic" trait allows you to increase your sadness level at any time using the special "contemplate" move)
    The player also selects a background that determines their character's initial emotional state along with some semi-hidden values that effect how your character reacts to certain events.
- [ ] emotional state tracking
    As the player directs their character to interact with their world, the character will be emotionally affected by the things they experience
- [ ] emotional stances
    The game tallies up your character's emotion values and uses them to determine your current "stance"
