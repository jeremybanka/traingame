I want to scale back my goals, and possibly focus in on the sleuth class as the main character archetype of the game. Finding evidence, drawing conclusions, investigating, and having breakdowns when your theories are proven wrong. Take influence from ace attorney.
all gameplay is going to center around the planned mechanics for the sleuth background. Character and narrative diversity will arise from the character's emotions and traits acquired either during character creation or through gameplay.

New concept for character creation.


Overall narrative:
Some sort of disaster befalls a train transporting people across the wastes. A number of people die, including almost all of the waitstaff. Only one waiter remains, and they refuse to work under the conditions. However, a number of powerful people are present on the train, and demand to be served. At their orders, the most freshly dead waiter was made into a wayfarer who would break the worker's one-man strike. When the supernaturalist employed by one of the powerful people attempted to summon a pliant spirit into the dead waiter's body, a mistake was made. Instead of a convenient scab, the spirit of the legendary private detective Burlock Golmes was summoned. Now it is the player's task to establish what exactly happened on this train, who caused it, where exactly you are, and what is going on.


Example of mechanics:
the rich undead character in the sleeper car will check your character for the 'wealthy' trait that can be picked at the beginning of the game. If you don't have it, he will ask your character to fetch his meal for him from the chef in the kitchen car, as he ordered it quite some time ago. if you have not found a way to straighten up your outfit before now, he will chastise you for your unprofessionalism and you will gain a goal to tidy up. When this conversation concludes, you will also gain the goal to find a way into the kitchen car.

if you approach the rich undead as a wizard, he will be quite scared of you. If you press him for information, he will cave. However, eventually he will betray you...

if you approach the rich undead while cursed, he will laugh at you.
